# Theft_Management

## Problem Definition
### Detecting and preventing theft in a supermarket
1. Large area
2. Malfunctioning tags
3. Limits on human resources
4. Limited budget

## Data collection

1. Location of the cameras
2. The data on stolen items
3. Info about stolen items
4. Data on the number and density of the employees
5. Location of all items

## Possible Solutions

### - Computer Vision
step 1. detecting high/low risk zones (using the location of the cameras)
step 2. detect the location of most stolen items
step 3. analysing on theft frequency by time (day of the week)
step 4. labeling the existing visual data
step 5. training and testing the prototype of the first model
step 6. testing on real time images

if the testing phase fail:
finding the reason of the faulty outcome
  get more data
  make the real-time detection faster
  ...

### - Wight detection
step 1. equip the shelves and the cart to a scale
step 2.
