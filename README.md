# Theft_Management

## Problem Definition
### Detecting and preventing theft in a supermarket
1. Large area
2. Malfunctioning tags
3. Limits on human resources
4. Limited budget

## Data collection

1. Location of the cameras
2. The data on stolen items
3. Info about stolen items
4. Data on the number and density of the employees
5. Location of all items

## Possible Solutions

### - Computer Vision
step 1. Detecting high/low-risk zones (using the location of the cameras)

step 2. Detect the location of most stolen items

step 3. Analyzing on theft frequency by time (day of the week)

step 4. Labeling the existing visual data

step 5. training and testing the prototype of the first model

step 6. Testing on real-time images

if the testing phase fails:
finding the reason of the faulty outcome
  get more data
  make the real-time detection faster
  ...

### - Wight detection

each customer has a specific shopping cart with a connected tag. each tag should connect to shelves to detect when  an item is removed from a shelf.

step 1. Equip the shelves and the shopping cart to a scale

step 2. Add a tag to the shopping cart

step 3. Software development to raise an alarm in case of not adding items after a limited time that it is removed from the shelf.

step 4. Testing functionality of software

step 5. testing prototype on a large scale

step 6. 

## Cost of Solution

it depends on:
1. cameras price
2. supermarket's size
3. supermarket's map
4. servers
5. scales
6. development of a system
7. test
